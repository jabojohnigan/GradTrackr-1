#GradTrackr

GradTrackr is an interactive, cross platform java application that allows admin and staff of an institution to follow the progress of their recent graduates. GradTrackr offers a full and secure database that quickly allows users to add, remove and run data reports on their graduates. 

GradTrackr was created with University of Washington Tacoma in mind. We worked closely with the admin and faculty to make sure that this product offers exactly what they requested.

Due to time constraints, our minimal viable product was able to provide functionality to all of our use cases. Through our view few short, but efficient sprints, we were able to create a product to present by our deadline.

However, we were unable to implement any design patterns or flashy GUI techniques. Our backend of is robust and can be easily transferred. The possibility of expansion and development of our program.
